Place a small popup on your site with a link to the official sacoronavirus.co.za government portal.

== Description ==

Per government regulations, every .za website has to have a home page link to the official portal at https://sacoronavirus.co.za

This plugin places a link on your homepage (and optionally every page) of your Wordpress site.

The plugin admin settings let you configure various aspects of the plugin: colours, fonts, size, position.

Super thanks to Electric Bookworks who developed the popup that this plugin displays. You can get that for websites that don't use wordpress: https://github.com/electricbookworks/sacoronavirus-link#readme
